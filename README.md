# Bake.and.whatever.else.I.make

I DO NOT OWN THE RIGHTS TO THESE IMAGES. The images I used are just place holders at the moment.

This is my first mock website build. Mainly playing around with the idea of a family owned bakery; A previous dream of mine. The plan going into this was to just relearn what code can do. So glad I have google because it was my #1 consultant, and even with that I was on the struggle bus. I'm going to periodically adjust and tweak this code, but I feel like I am going to study it and use as a callback for other projects in the mean time.
